# 📧 Demo Application – Email Assistant

This project is a simple demo of an AI assistant designed for **composing and sending emails**. 

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

This demo demonstrates:

- ✅ How **tool calling** works with Large Language Models (LLMs) using just plain Java
- ✅ That building **agentic workflows** doesn't necessarily require Python or frameworks like LangChain
- ✅ How a few lines of integration code can enable powerful AI applications

---

## 🤖 Assistant Behavior

- 📨 Specializes in **email composition only**
- 🚫 Rejects unrelated queries with a clear reminder of its email-only focus
- ❓ Interactively asks for required email information:
    - Recipient's name and email (mandatory)
    - Sender's name (mandatory)
    - Category (e.g., appointment, meeting request)
    - Style (e.g., casual, formal)
    - Language and other optional details
- 💾 Uses a memory tool to **persist collected data**. It stores collected data in a file called 'memory.txt'
- ✅ Asks for user confirmation before sending an email:
  > _"Should I send the email now?"_

## 💡 Notes

- 🔄 You're **not limited to the Claude API** for testing or using this example. However, the code was only tested with **Anthropic's Claude API**.
- ⚠️ The initial version of this code was **generated by an LLM**. It is for **educational/demo purposes only**.
